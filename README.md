## How to Contribute?

We welcome contributions to our project! Follow these steps to contribute via a pull request:

1. Fork the Repository: Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository's GitHub page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the git clone command followed by the URL of your fork. For example:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

3. Create a New Branch: Create a new branch to work on your changes. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you're making. For example:

git checkout -b feature/new-feature

4. Make Changes: Make your desired changes to the codebase using your preferred text editor or IDE.

5. Commit Changes: Once you've made your changes, commit them to your local repository using the git commit command. Be sure to provide a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you've made. For example:

git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

6. Push Changes: Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the git push command. For example:

git push origin feature/new-feature

7. Create a Pull Request: Go to the GitHub page of your forked repository and click on the "New pull request" button. Compare the changes between your branch and the original repository's main branch. Provide a descriptive title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made.

8. Review and Discuss: After creating the pull request, other contributors or maintainers may review your changes and provide feedback. Be responsive to any comments or suggestions that are made.

9. Address Feedback (If Necessary): If feedback is provided, make any necessary changes to your code based on the feedback received. Commit and push the changes to your branch.

10. Merge Pull Request: Once your pull request has been approved and all discussions have been resolved, a maintainer of the original repository will merge your changes into the main branch.
